# madelbrot_set

This is just a simple program to study the lovely and beutifull Mandelbrot set. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c  does not converge as z_0 = 0. To check if z goes to infinity, it's enough to check if any |z_n| > 2. Computaionally this can be check to some number of preciossions of n.
