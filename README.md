# madelbrot_set

This is just a simple program to study the lovely and beutifull Mandelbrot set. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set)

The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers c for which z_{n+1} = z_n^2 + c  does converge as z_0 = 0. To check if z does go to infinity, it's enough to check if any |z_n| > 2. Computaionally this can be check to some number of preciossions of n.

To do: plotting the "debth" of at which n the series is found to converge. Using different colours for this gives the really interesting graph that is found to be fractal. 

To do: ability to zoom into to the picture (or graph) and explore the fractal nature of this set.
